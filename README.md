# fgbuttons

## run this project using Docker (see DOCKER_README)

## Dev Notes

1. I used bootstrap-vue to make a grid to position the elements in the bottom right corner

2. I didn't find all of the exact icons from the image to emulate so I improvised

3. I wrote rudimentary unit tests, not full coverage

4. Things I learned: I haven't used layered bootstrap icons until now.

## testing

- if you want to run tests from inside the docker VM (container) see docker readme

- you can also do an `npm i` to install dependencies, then run `npm run test:unit`
